This has three effects.First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, cure light wounds cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast prayer, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target's friendship with the cleric.Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges.This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use atonement to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; remove curse also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the reprobation.", "School" : "universal", "Spell Resistance" : "yes", "monsters" : "[]", "components" : "[V,S,DF]", "keywords" : "[cast,target,religion,curs,punish,act,misde,tenet,faith,three,effect,first,mark,magic,symbol,visibl,member,indic,transgress,help,likewis,persecut,though,would,keep,law,imprison,known,crimin,crime,taken,place,gain,second,longer,affect,spell,alwai,treat,enemi,purpos,exampl,cure,light,wound,travel,cleric,prayer,penal,rather,aid,despit,friendship,third,divin,spellcast,prestig,class,otherwis,abil,belong,cannot,remain,paladin,unabl,lai,hand,join,anoth,regain,even,new,accept,power,save,throw,sever,deserv,death,prefer,merci,mete,howev,drawback,prevent,overus,commit,instead,innoc,charg,potenti,backlash,inquisit,run,corrupt,mean,accus,misconduct,carefulli,investig,usual,verifi,sentenc,remov,like,addit,aton,break,make,caster,level,check,also,requir,end,reprob]", "Targets" : "one creature of your faith", "Casting Time" : "1 minute", "Saving Throw" : "none", "Range" : "close (25 ft. + 5 ft.\/2 levels)"}])

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death.The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated.

You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface-you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must make a Reflex save to avoid falling into the rift. If the Reflex save is successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the boiling pools of acid, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss.A creature that falls into the pit takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the pit (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the pit's environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the pit rather than at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round, and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the pit can make a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The pit's walls have a Climb DC of 25.When this spell's duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift's environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.At any time during the spell's duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens out into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell's duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area-these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via summon monster VII, and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the rift of ruin spell.

When inscribed, the rune of Jandelay manifests as a shape that evokes the face of a monstrous elephantine creature-the legendary Oliphant of Jandelay itself. The rune is 5 feet across when created, and the surface on which it is to be inscribed must be large enough to bear it. The rune of Jandelay is a potent ward against the primal chaos of the Great Beyond. While it is primarily intended to combat the forces of the Maelstrom, it is equally useful against forces from the other chaotic Outer Planes. When cast, the rune stabilizes and reinforces an area in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Earthquake, transmute rock to mud, stone shape, spike stones, and other spell effects that magically damage or manipulate terrain or structures deal no damage and do not alter anything in the area. Damaging spells that specifically target these structures or regions do not deal damage, but area-affecting spells may damage creatures in the area as normal. Strong chaos planar alignment is reduced to mild alignment, and mild chaos planar alignment is negated entirely in this area. Creatures with the chaotic subtype in the area of a rune of Jandelay must save against the spell or gain 2 negative levels for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that saves and leaves the area must save again upon reentering the area. These negative levels can never result in permanent level loss but cannot be restored by restoration or similar magic.", "School" : "transmutation", "Spell Resistance" : "no", "monsters" : "[]", "components" : "[V,S,M]", "keywords" : "[scribe,potent,rune,power,upon,surfac,similar,wai,symbol,spell,cast,inscrib,jandelai,manifest,shape,evok,face,monstrou,elephantin,creatur,legendari,oliph,feet,across,creat,must,larg,enough,bear,ward,primal,chao,great,beyond,primarili,intend,combat,forc,maelstrom,equal,chaotic,outer,plane,stabil,reinforc,area,foot,radiu,sphere,center,earthquak,transmut,rock,mud,stone,spike,effect,magic,damag,manipul,terrain,structur,deal,alter,anyth,specif,target,region,affect,mai,normal,strong,planar,align,reduc,mild,negat,entir,subtyp,save,gain,neg,level,long,remain,leav,reenter,never,result,perman,loss,cannot,restor]", "Casting Time" : "3 rounds", "Saving Throw" : "see below", "Range" : "0 ft. see text"}])
